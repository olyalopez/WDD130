    <p>Hello everyone, 
    I am Ukrainian despite my current Spanish last name. This year I will turn 35.<br>
    I had been living in Kyiv before moving to the UK last year. And I have a 7yo sweet curly son!</p>
    <p>I love to discover and learn new things and places.<br>
    And, even though I am introverted, I enjoy meeting and making friends with new people.<br>
    My hobbies are yoga/stretching and crocheting.</p>
    </p>I joined the Church in 2004. Literally, my brother introduced it to me<br>
    by having brought an advertisement of free English courses.<br>
    At that moment, I was so sure in my special connection with God so wanted to prove<br>
    that the Church was not true. And I failed:) </p>
    <p>Thank you for reading my introduction. I am looking forward to learning with you!</p>
