            <h1>What is SIRF?</h1>
            <p>The Stockton International Riverside Festival (SIRF) is an annual free outdoor arts festival in Stockton-on-Tees, England. The first Stockton Riverside Festival was founded by Frank Wilson and took place in August 1988. Since the mid-1990s SIRF has been funded by Stockton Borough Council and since 2012 the council has received fundings from Arts Council England to the value of about £200,000 per annum.</p>
            <p>Stockton International Riverside Festival returns from Thursday 3 - Sunday 6 August 2023. The main show of this year is the spectacular "Perceptions" by Bivouac, France. The show starts on Friday 4 August, with a repeat on Saturday. Also, this year SIRF promises  a range of street performers including Akademi, Unlimited Theatre and Upswing, 2 Faced Dance, 16rpm, and Teatro So and a special "Alive after Five" welcome party on Thursday.</p>
            <p>The SIRF community carnival programe supports local schools and community groups to create costumes, carnival structures, music and performances. interpreted annually agreed theme becomes a vibrant and colourful procession through the centre of Stockton starting at noon on Saturday. By 2016, it had grown to 1200 participants. </p>
            
            <p>If you enjoy a day packed with music, joy, shows and unforgettable emotions, you are welcomed to SIRF which cemented its place as one of the world’s oldest and best international outdoor art festivals.</p>
            <p>And, despite its loud name and long history (35 years in 2022), unfortunately, not all local people have visited it even once in their whole life. That fact makes an impression that we do not really value treasure we have underestimating its potential and influence. Diving into the everyday troubles, we miss outstanding celebration of life, creativity and diverse emotions that happens just around the corner. </p>
            <p>It’s just not possible to miss such a massive event because the preparation commences almost a week before the official start and some roads have to be closed that, perhaps, creates some inconveniences to the local people. However, those small difficulties cannot be compared with the scale of delight, wonder and satisfaction that much-loved and signature festival brings into the town leaving long-lasting memories for many years to come.</p>
            <p>So, do not miss this fabulous event and schedule the time to contemplate it personally this August!</p>
