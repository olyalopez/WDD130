            <h2>Stockton-on-Tees</h2>
            <p>Stockton-on-Tees is a market town on the North-East of England with the population of about 84000.</p>
            <p>In 1822, inhabitants of Stockton witnessed an event which changed the face of the world forever, and which launched a new era in the way people were doing business and travelled. The Stockton and Darlington Railway was the first railway in the world to operate freight and passenger service with steam traction.</p>
            <p>Another development occurred in 1827 when local chemist John Walker invented the friction match in his shop at 59 High Street, Stockton. Since he did not get a patent, Walker received neither fame nor money for his invention.</p>
            <p>SIRF takes place in Stockton town centre which central street, High Street, is the widest in the UK. At its centre stands Stockton-on-Tees Town Hall dating from 1735.</p>
            <p>Many people are astonished with the scale of demolition that is currently undergoing in the very heart of Stockton. Seems like God decided to remove it from the face of Earth, but no: the reason is that the council plans to tear down Castlegate Shopping Centre (1972) and Swallow Hotel and replace them with a £37 million riverside urban park three times the size of Trafalgar Square. The new park is planned to open by 2025. The realization of a long-held ambition to open up the town will only benefit for the future of SIRF and further development of Stockton as a whole.
