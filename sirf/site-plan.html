        The Stockton International Riverside Festival (SIRF) is an annual free outdoor arts festival in Stockton-on-Tees, England. The first Stockton Riverside Festival was founded by Frank Wilson and took place in August 1988. Since the mid-1990s SIRF has been funded by Stockton Borough Council and since 2012 the council has received fundings from Arts Council England to the value of about £200,000 per annum.
      </p>
      <p>Stockton International Riverside Festival returns from Thursday 3 - Sunday 6 August 2023. The main show of this year is the spectacular "Perceptions" by Bivouac, France. The show starts on Friday 4 August, with a repeat on Saturday. Also, this year SIRF promises  a range of street performers including Akademi, Unlimited Theatre and Upswing, 2 Faced Dance, 16rpm, and Teatro So and a special "Alive after Five" welcome party on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The SIRF community carnival programe supports local schools and community groups to create costumes, carnival structures, music and performances. interpreted annually agreed theme becomes a vibrant and colourful procession through the centre of Stockton starting at noon on Saturday. By 2016, it had grown to 1200 participants. </p>
      
      <p>If you enjoy a day packed with music, joy, shows and unforgettable emotions, you are welcomed to SIRF which cemented its place as one of the world’s oldest and best international outdoor art festivals.</p>
      <p>And, despite its loud name and long history (35 years in 2022), unfortunately, not all local people have visited it even once in their whole life. That fact makes an impression that we do not really value treasure we have underestimating its potential and influence. Diving into the everyday troubles, we miss outstanding celebration of life, creativity and diverse emotions that happens just around the corner. </p>
      <p>It’s just not possible to miss such a massive event because the preparation commences almost a week before the official start and some roads have to be closed that, perhaps, creates some inconveniences to the local people. However, those small difficulties cannot be compared with the scale of delight, wonder and satisfaction that much-loved and signature festival brings into the town leaving long-lasting memories for many years to come.</p>
      <p>So, do not miss this fabulous event and schedule the time to contemplate it personally this August!</p>

      <h3>SIRF'22</h3>
      <p>In 2022 SIRF returned to Stockton for the first time since 2019. It launched with the thrill and amazement of French company Gratte Ciel’s massive scale spectacle Tawa. As live music filled the air and heated the atmosphere around, aerialists and acrobats spined in a dramatic unforgettable explosion of colours on Stockton Riverside with breath-taking acts of human strength and resilience.</p>
      <p>A small group of audience definitely felt privileged to be present there contemplating tremendous incredible show that was worth to be displayed in any capital of the whole world. It was so difficult to believe that so few people decided to do something different on their Thursday evening and, instead of watching TV or relaxing in the garden, chose to come to a lovely place of Stockton Riverside with three bridges across the river to witness inspiring show.</p>
      <p>The rest of three days people were able to choose whatever they preferred spending the whole day in the down centre just moving from one place to another because each corner was literally packed with fun, amusement and joy.</p>
      <p>All evening performances were memorable and captivating like, for instance, a fire show Envol, by Entre Terre et Ciel, or performance of light, texture and movement by a team of Limbic Cinema, Full Tilt Aerial and South Korean composers Salamanda that had a place in an ancient Trinity Church.

      <h3>Venue</h3>
      <p>Stockton-on-Tees is a market town on the North-East of England with the population of about 84000.</p>
      <p>In 1822, inhabitants of Stockton witnessed an event which changed the face of the world forever, and which launched a new era in the way people were doing business and travelled. The Stockton and Darlington Railway was the first railway in the world to operate freight and passenger service with steam traction.</p>
      <p>Another development occurred in 1827 when local chemist John Walker invented the friction match in his shop at 59 High Street, Stockton. Since he did not get a patent, Walker received neither fame nor money for his invention.</p>
      <p>SIRF takes place in Stockton town centre which central street, High Street, is the widest in the UK. At its centre stands Stockton-on-Tees Town Hall dating from 1735.</p>
      <p>Many people are astonished with the scale of demolition that is currently undergoing in the very heart of Stockton. Seems like God decided to remove it from the face of Earth, but no: the reason is that the council plans to tear down Castlegate Shopping Centre (1972) and Swallow Hotel and replace them with a £37 million riverside urban park three times the size of Trafalgar Square. The new park is planned to open by 2025. The realization of a long-held ambition to open up the town will only benefit for the future of SIRF and further development of Stockton as a whole.
